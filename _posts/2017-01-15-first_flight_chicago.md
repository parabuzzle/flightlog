So I recently moved to Chicago for work and I've wanted to fly planes for as long as I could remember.

Today I went out to Schaumburg Regional Airport (06C) to do my first flight in a Cessna 172. There is nothing that can compare to hitting rotation speed, pulling back, and leaving the ground as the pilot holding the controls.

First day flying, and I was able to do slow flight within ACS standards. Winning!
