Today was forecast to be the best weather we've had in months. I woke up and checked the METAR and TAFs to find that the forecast was spot on with solid VFR weather.

This is the METAR during my planned flight time:

KDPA 182052Z 21004KT 10SM CLR 12/M04 A2995 RMK AO2 SLP147 T01221044 56026
~~~

And yet, I wasn't out flying... Why? well, my instructor was called away to do a charter flight. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem. 
My frustration stems from a few compounding issues. 

The first is that I'm very close to my checkride and I needed today to finish the required minimums to get the endorsement to do the checkride.

The second is that I've been at this for over a year and I've been motivated to do a lot of training quickly. Its taken this long because of broken planes and lack of instructor availability. 

The last is that my flight school and the charter service are the same company. Which means that the flight school chose to cancel my training flight (and others today) to do a charter flight.

I'll be so glad to be finished with this flight school after this upcoming checkride (if it ever happens).
